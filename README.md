# GUI_DALLE2
This is a GUI for DALL-E 2 built using tkinter(Python library)
DALLÂ·E 2 is a new AI system from 'OpenAI' that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language.
I have called their API(available on their website) and does not hold any copyrights and this is done purely for leisure purposes.
